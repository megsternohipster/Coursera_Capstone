<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>Background/Business
Problem</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>As different health ailments are on
the rise and people look to be healthier with their bodies and minds, the trend
to convert to a vegetarian/vegan diet is nothing new. In a study conducted by EPIC-Oxford,
it was found that vegetarians were, on average, 25% less likely to die of heart
disease. Further to this, if you stop eating red meat (whether or not you
become a vegetarian), you'll eliminate a risk factor for colon cancer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>People choose to become vegetarian
for several reasons, including: religious convictions, concerns about animal
welfare or the use of antibiotics and hormones in livestock, or a desire to eat
in a way that avoids excessive use of environmental resources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>With the rise in individuals around
the globe turning to a vegetarian diet and businesses taking advantage of this
trend, it is clear that this type of analysis would be great for a restaurant
owner who is looking to open up a restaurant in the neighborhoods of Toronto,
Canada.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Data</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The data used in this project are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>List of postal codes of Canada Wiki:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M for access to
neighborhood data of Toronto region.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods:
http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data for getting the longitude and latitude data for
the neighborhoods.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Foursquare database: https://Foursquare.com to be used in order
to explore the desired neighborhood data for various venue details and access
the JSON files. This data shall be utilized to map the venue in neighborhoods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Research Methodology</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this project, I used multiple sources such as wiki data,
geocodes, Foursquare API, beautifulsoup to conduct web scrapping and
preprocessing of data. Below I have outlined all this information</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you can see in the code, there were many Boroughs not
assigned or NaN so they were removed and the Postal Code variable was changed for
indexing done later. Once the data was cleaned up, the latitude and longitudes
were added for each location and columns were rearranged so the data frame was
easier to read. Furthermore, new tables were created with latitudes and
longitudes corresponding to different Postal Codes. Then, the foursquare API
was used to get venues in the radius of 500 meters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neighborhoods were clustered and k-means was used to
determine how many neighborhoods per cluster exists. It was then determined
which cluster has the most amount of vegan/vegetarian restaurants and which
neighborhood is best for opening a new restaurant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Helvetica",sans-serif;color:black;background:white'>Most of the Vegan/Vegetarian
Restaurants are in cluster 1 represented by the red clusters. The Neighborhoods
located in the Toronto area that have the highest average of Vegan Restaurants
is North York. Even though there is a huge amount of Neighborhoods in cluster
2, there are little to no Vegan Restaurant. We see that in the Downtown Toronto
area (cluster 3) has the second last average of Vegan Restaurants. Looking at
the nearby venues, the optimum place to put a new Vegan Restaurant is in Cluster
3 as there are many Neighborhoods in the area but little to no Vegan
Restaurants therefore, eliminating any competition. The second best
Neighborhoods that have a great opportunity would be in areas in Cluster 2.
Having 70 neighborhoods in the area with little to no Vegan Restaurants gives a
good opportunity for opening up a new restaurant. This concludes the optimal
findings for this project and recommends the entrepreneur to open an authentic Vegan
restaurant in these locations with little to no competition. </span></p>
